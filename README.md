Hi Humans!

Rancid here, I like to Jump from planet to planet with no idea why. Its just fun bouncing from planet to plant and seeing all the different spieces of humaniods thruout the Universes. Its amanzing just how dumb humans are on Earth. They have no idea of what they are capable of. They are so wrappted up in bullshit that they have fallen so far behind in advances that they could have all ready saved the planet from extinction.

If only they new!!

Rancid
